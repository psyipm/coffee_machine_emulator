# Coffee machine emulator

Design a vending machine in code. The vending machine, once a product is selected and the appropriate amount of money is inserted, should return that product. It should also return change if too much money is provided or ask for more money if there is not enough. Keep in mind that you need to manage the scenario where the item is out of stock or the machine does not have enough change to return to the customer.

# How to run it

From within a project directory run a command:

```bash
  ruby main.rb
```

# Usage

Pick a product from the list, input corresponding number and press `enter`.
Input a coin value from keyboard and press `enter`.

# Testing

```bash
  bundle install
```

```bash
  bundle exec rspec
```
